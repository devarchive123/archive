# License Key Storage - GitHub Pages JSON

This repository hosts a `keys.json` file used to validate license keys for external applications or plugins.

## 🔐 How it works

- Valid license keys are stored in `keys.json`
- Remote applications can fetch the file from GitHub Pages and check for validity
- Example usage: license system for mods, plugins, etc.

## 📁 JSON Format

```json
{
  "keys": [
    "SHAU@Uashadasd2w",
    "afhqufhqf21q21",
    "1ju1hu1hqfqf"
  ]
}
